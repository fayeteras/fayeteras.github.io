      <h1 class="page-title">PAST WORK</h1>
      <p class="projects-summary"> During my first two years at Purdue University in the Visual Communication Design major, I have had the opportunity to complete a diverse range of projects, including graphic design, web design, and print design. These projects have allowed me to develop my skills in various software programs, particularly the Adobe Creative Suite, which I have used extensively. Throughout my sophomore year, I have worked on several design pieces that reflect my growth in both creativity and technical proficiency. Below are just a few examples of the work I produced during this time.

          <h2>Visual Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Project from Purdue AD226 : <br />
            For this project, I created a cohesive visual system around five
            distinct dance styles: Ballet, hip hop, tap, jazz, and character.
            This project allowed me to explore the complexities of creating a
            cohesive yet varied visual system, pushing me to find the balance
            between individual and unified designs.

            class="project-image"
          />
          <p>
            To start the project I created a mood board using images for each style of dance.
            I used the images to curate a color scheme that I used for my icons and app mockups.
            This process allowed me to establish a consistent style before beginning my ideation.

          <p>
            I created mockups of and app concept that could utilize my icons.
            I chose to design an app for finding and scheduling nearby dance
            classes, using my icons as a basis for style and color theme and
            building from there.

            Project from Purdue AD205 : <br />
            For this project, I was challenged to choose an onomatopaea and an illustration and create an accordian style booklet.
            I chose the work 'Honk' and created an illustration of a goose and experimented with typography, composition, and color.

            My process included initial sketches of my image, and ideation for each of the pages. My goal was to create a balance
            through color, pattern, shape, and my use of negative space. For each page I took a unique aproach while maintaining a consistent
            theme to create a cohesive spread.

          <h2>Movie Poster</h2>
          <p>
            Project from Purdue AD227 : <br />
            For this project, I began by researching surrealist art and fantasy movie posters like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and The Lord of the Rings.
            I focused on identifying recurring visual motifs that embody the magical essence of the fantasy genre.          
          </p>
          <p>
            During the development process, I explored a variety of surrealist techniques. My final composition blends vibrant colors, intricate details,
             and fluid transitions to highlight the films magical world while maintaining a focus on storytelling. Balancing surrealism with fantasy required 
             careful consideration of visual hierarchy and typography, ensuring that the fantastical elements didnâ€™t overwhelm the design.

          <h2>Event Card</h2>
          <p>
            Project from Purdue AD227 : <br />
            For this project, I created a visually engaging event card for the Cincinnati Festival of Lights, focusing on clarity, professionalism, and an inviting 
            aesthetic. I drew inspiration from light festivals and winter celebrations, using dynamic light patterns, contrasting colors, and festive imagery to reflect
             the event's spirit. I designed a clean layout to emphasize key details such as the event title, location, and ticket prices, ensuring clear communication.
            </p>
          <p>
            This project challenged me to blend creativity with technical precision in designing an event card for the Cincinnati Festival of Lights. I incorporated 
            jellyfish light graphics and a rainbow tunnel to capture the event's magical spirit. 
            Through experimenting with multiple font styles, I developed a cohesive system that enhances the festive tone while maintaining readability, resulting in
             a lively and polished design.
